Hello! My name is Paarmita Pandey. I am a 4th-year PhD Candidate at The Ohio State University, Department of Astronomy. I am primarily a multiwavelength observational astronomer with broad interests.

I work with Prof. Laura Lopez and Prof. Todd Thompson on understanding **cosmic-ray acceleration and transport in star-forming galaxies** using **Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data**.

I also work with Prof. Chris Kochanek and the ASAS-SN team on analyzing the new class of transients known as **Ambiguous Nuclear Transients (ANTs)**.

**Contact:** pandey.176@osu.edu
