I come from a small town in India where access to education for women is limited. Without early mentors, I found guidance only in college. It was an experience that shaped my journey and inspired my commitment to mentorship.

I am part of the leadership team of the [Supernova Foundation](https://supernovafoundation.org/), serving as the **Outreach and Mentoring Coordinator**. The Supernova Foundation is a global mentoring program dedicated to empowering young women and gender minorities pursuing careers in Physics. As of October 2025, it supports 400+ members across 50+ countries.

I also mentor students through the [Polaris Mentorship Program](https://u.osu.edu/polaris/), supporting and broadening the participation of undergraduate students in Physics and Astronomy through academic and professional guidance.

Through these roles, I aim to support various scientific communities by ensuring that aspiring astrophysicists receive the mentorship and support I once lacked.
