I am originally from Uttar Pradesh, India, and my mother tongue is Hindi. I did my BS-MS in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, India. 

In my free time, I enjoy doing Yoga, biking, and playing with my pets. I have a cat named Lana Purr Ray who is the sweetest girl in the world. I also have a dog named Bobo, who loves sprinting and making new friends. Here are their pictures. Enjoy!
